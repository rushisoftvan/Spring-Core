1) what is spring bean
- which java class manage by ioc contational it's called spring bean.

2)how to represent java class as spring bean
 - by using xml configration  <bean id="student" class="com.learn.Student"
 - by using annotation(@Component,@Service, @Repositry)

3) if our class dependent to another class then how ew can inject it for that we have to say to spring by using the annotation @Autowired😐️
we can use this anoottaion on variable, Method , Constructer


- if we use on method level it's called setter injection 
  if we will use on constructer level hen it called constructer level injection
  if we will use on variable level  it called filed level injection  

4) @Configration we have to tell to spring to read this class and to create object which available in class

5) @Bean It is to when we have to create object of the class and give to this object for  to the ioc to manage this object
 we have to use this bean for swagger configratio, Security configratuion

@Repositry we use on dao class because if any  occure when we communicate with database if we use the @Repositry it will transfer the message  exception in good manner

@qualifier we have to use if two bean are available for the same type there is am 

In spring framwork we have to enable the annotation in configration xml file <context: annotation cpnfig/>
